Just a few pointers if you want to make changes to buildviz:

## Run the server locally

    $ ./lein do deps, ring server

## Run the tests

    $ ./go

## UI regression tests

    $ ./test/serve_ui_test.sh
    $ open http://localhost:8000/test/RegressionRunner.html

## Inspect JUnit XML file

    $ ./lein run -m buildviz.data.junit-xml MY_JUNIT_RESULTS.xml

## Run sync for GoCD locally

    $ ./lein run -m buildviz.go.sync http://$USER:$PW@localhost:8153/go

## Generate the standalone jar

    $ ./lein ring uberjar

## Make a new release

    $ ./go make_release 1.2.3

## Re-generating the recorded traffic from actual GoCD server

Re-generating the traffic, captured via wiremock, is necessary if a new API is
accessed in the sync that hasn't been captured yet, or any URL access has been
slightly changed:

    $ ./test/integration/record_gocd.sh

The recorded file needs to be checked in to provide regression testing for the
relevant sync job.
